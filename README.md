# debian-workspace
workspace on debian

You just found my workspace that I'm using to simplify my workflow. It's pretty easy to set it up yourself.
Just run the setup.sh with it:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molikuner-setup/debian-workspace/master/setup.sh | bash
```
Or because `curl` isn't preinstalled on some systems:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molikuner-setup/debian-workspace/master/setup.sh -O - | bash
```
Please note that I've never tested the setup script.
